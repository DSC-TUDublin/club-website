# How to Contribute

This project is open source. As such you'll see the development unfold here, not just the pretty final releases. We welcome any outside ideas & help!

## Contributing a new addon or new addon idea

**FIRST CHECK THAT IT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN OPENED AS AN ISSUE**

Open an issue titled "Issue" followed by a descriptive name for your problem, the comment should contain a brief explanation of your problem and (if you know) the cause. This let's us know if the issue has already been reported, or been solved in a branch already.

If you wish to not only report the problem, but fix it yourself: Fork the repo & create a new branch titled `issue_fix-<your addon name>` from the dev branch. Post a comment on the issue you've created containing "WIP" and a link to **the branch** you just created in your fork. You can create further branches from there if need be, named like so: `issue_fix-<your addon name>-<sub branch name>`. This should follow the structure outlined in TEMP.
